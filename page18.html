    <p>When planning my website, I struggled for a long time to come up with a coherent theme and method for my 
        website as a whole. Eventually however, i settled on the decision to make it nature and location based, 
        showing a sleek and attractive image related to the natural world for each page visited. I decided to have 
        my text be written in a blocky, noticeable font and sit on top of my images with a white colouration, so 
        that they stand out against the dark nature images. In the end, my project ended up looking nature-based 
        with a professional, informational tilt which I am glad about. I believe the finished product is unique to 
        my preferences and demonstrates who I am as a person.
