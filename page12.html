    <p>Based on my analysis of what was ineffective regarding my finished website project, I have discovered a 
        number of things that could be improved drastically. First of all, if i were to provide drop down menus 
        or button keys, it would massively improve ease of navigation and look more impressive. Furthermore, if 
        i had included more links and page structure, my finished project would appear even more professional than 
        it already does.
