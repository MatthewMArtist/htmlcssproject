    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 1, task 1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact 
        digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <div class = "text_font_2">
    <p>The GDPR is a law that governs the collecting, storing and dissemination of people's private information. 
        It affects digital products by restricting the activity that they and their creators can take part in 
        regarding the collection and storage of customer and employee information. As a result, those who create 
        such a project must be careful to make sure that they operate within the boundaries of the law at all 
        times and avoid stealing and disseminating that information. [5]</p>
    <p>“The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR for short) is built around two key principles.</p>
    <p>- Giving citizens and residents more control of their personal data</p>
    <p>- Simplifying regulations for international businesses with a unifying regulation that stands across 
        the European Union (EU)” [6]</p>
