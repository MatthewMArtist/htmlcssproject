    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 1, task 1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects â€“ what causes digital 
        projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p">The first thing that could cause a digital project to fail is a lack of 
        employees with the necessary skills. This means that they are unable to 
        achieve certain aspects of the project that are vital to its success, 
        inevitably leading to a failed result.</p>
    <p>Another thing that could cause failure in such a project would be an 
        incorrectly researched and executed planning phase that ends up asking 
        for something totally unsuitable. This usually results in a team or single 
        developer who, whilst following the plan, ends up submitting a sub-par 
        finished product that does not meet the needs of the company requesting it.</p>
    <p>A final reason that a digital project could fail is inadequate time given 
        to the projects timeline in comparison to the resources available to be 
        used. In this case, regardless of how hard the employees work on the 
        project, they are unable to produce a finished one because the deadline 
        is massively shorter than their skills and funds can abide by.</p>
