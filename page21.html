    <p>The most important file type for creation of a website is the HTML file type. It is the core of the program 
        and responsible for allowing connection to the internet and google. Other necessary file types include 
        jpeg, gif, css, avi and others. These are all useful for various functions that affect aesthetics and 
        function, and vital for creating a website that is more than just basic text and related functions. Html 
        is the coding language I shall be using in order to create my website, whilst CSS will be used to make it 
        look good.
