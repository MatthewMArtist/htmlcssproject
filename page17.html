        solutions</h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>When applying digital solutions to the digital issues i ran into, i made proficient usage of tools such 
        as google internet explorer, websites that answer coding and business related questions, and advice from 
        sites such as slack and moodle that ensure iâ€™m always aware of what i need to do and how generally to do 
        it. I ended up using all of these methods equally, which meant that I tackled all aspects of my website 
        equally and ensured a certain standard of success across the board. In particular, the linked coding 
        solutions were vital to the success of the project as they ensured i did not become held up by individual 
        coding issues, thus allowing me to go on to complete the rest of my website.
