    <p>Copyright law can both negatively and positively affect the potential of a digital project and the 
        business that owns it. On the good side, it allows them to create something unique and be confident 
        in the fact that they hold the rights to it, if they go through the process required to copyright it. 
        On the other hand, such processes can be very slow and costly, and are not guaranteed to secure the 
        license with certainty. Even worse, if you accidentally create a product too similar to another one or 
        something that is old, but still copyrighted, you could be struck by a fine or even sued a large amount 
        of money, disrupting your project and business proceedings. [6]
