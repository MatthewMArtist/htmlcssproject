    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>Ways to improve productivity in business range from a more engaging work environment, more training on the 
        part of the project members, better management of deadlines, contorting the project to fall within the 
        project members skill sets and proper management and task assignment. These all improve productivity by 
        enhancing the team members willingness to work regardless of their physical state, providing a guaranteed 
        boost to productivity. Vitral to all of these are also an effective array of tracking methods, such as 
        trello boards and project storage sites such as github.
