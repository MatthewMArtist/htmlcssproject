    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 3, task 3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of 
        productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you 
        have done it in teams?</h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>I could’ve been more efficient by tracking my progress on trello. This would’ve prevented me from getting 
        side tracked and made sure i was aware of the quantity of work left to do, thus improving my productivity. 
        Furthermore, it would’ve ensured i initially collected the correct number of images, wasting less time in 
        correcting that once i found out that i needed to add pages. Another way I could've been more efficient is 
        get more sleep at home so that I could be fresher faced towards the end of the day, enabling me to work 
        where previously I was too tired to think straight. Had we done this project in teams, we would’ve 
        completed it far earlier but with less uniqueness, and the potential to bite off too much work, thus 
        returning our time spent to a single person’s required time.
