    <p>My name is Matthew Morris and I'm an artist who aspires to make his own game. I have spent two months 
        learning to code and many years learning to draw in various styles. I decided to learn to code because 
        I realised that I had the opportunity to make a unique and interesting gaming experience, and felt 
        compelled not to ignore that urge. I intend on becoming effective in multiple languages so that when I 
        initiate the beginning of my games project, I will be well versed in coding and be able to fulfill it 
        to the constraints of my timeframe.</p>
