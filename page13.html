    <p>Of the separate requirements i have been given (preparing appropriate content, organising information, 
        using appropriate editing, using development techniques, changing file formats and making error free pages 
        that are fit for purpose), i have achieved all of them to an acceptable standard and as a result own a 
        fully completed version of my required website. I have prepared the information and pictures in valid 
        formatting, edited it to improve over time as my preferences changed, organised the separate answers in 
        individual pages, incorporated professional development techniques for formatting and image use, changed 
        file formats from html to css and checked for errors whilst removing them.
