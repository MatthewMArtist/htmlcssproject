        Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>
    <div>
    <p class = "text_font_2">When planning and enacting the development of my website, I shall use the Trello 
        website extensively by working on one of its trello boards. Within this I shall detail all future tasks, 
        activities I’m working on completing as well as finished tasks, so that I understand exactly how the 
        project stands at any time. This way, I will always be aware of what I need to do next and record all 
        previous progress for future reference.</p>
    <p class = "text_font_2">Furthermore, I will be using trello as a reference point to see what my written tasks 
        are easily, checking it repeatedly in order to get a clear idea of what the task describes - Then store 
        those tasks as completed once I finish them. [4]
