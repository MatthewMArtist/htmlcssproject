    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 2, task 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as 
        needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? </h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>I am very happy with the majority of tools I used to make my website. The basic selection of them gave my 
        every option needed to create a professional looking website in several easy steps, from background images 
        to text alteration, to font correction and more. Most crucially, I found them to be easy to understand and 
        use, barring the requirements to move the locations of text, though even then i could understand the logic 
        of it and apply it to limited extents. The tools I used were visual studio code, google, github, slack, 
        trello, various coding and IT websites and more. In particular i used visual studio code to its fullest 
        extent, making use of both the html and css coding languages within it.
