    <p>I will need to use trello during my project in order to adequately plan out my actions 
        in the future, and label that they’re solved as i complete them. I will also need a pen and a lot of paper 
        for jotting down notes, which will be invaluable for when it will be difficult to do so electronically. 
        Furthermore, I will need access to coding tutorials online so that I may learn the requisite coding skills 
        required for website development, alongside visual studio code in order to enact it. The skills I will 
        require involve knowledge regarding page swapping, interaction with google and other search engines, 
        general basic coding knowledge and the ability to create links and/or images/videos.</p>
    <p>In particular, I should have the skills required to understand and build tcode using HTML, as this is the 
        method by which all web development occurs on the internet. Furthermore, I should also have skills in 
        using javascript, as most websites require it in order to work. [3]</p>
