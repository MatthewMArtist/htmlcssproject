    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 1, task 1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen 
        technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and 
        GitHub help with your codes version control.</h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>My chosen technologies and systems have helped me achieve my objective in a number of ways. To begin with, 
        trello has been vital for tracking the completion of all written documents, as well as prompting me to try 
        and learn new code. Had I not been able to access it, I would not have had as good of a grasp on my 
        progress, and so I would have achieved less in this timeframe. Furthermore, the laptop I achieved this on 
        was vital to the success of everything regarding this objective, from understanding what I have to do, to 
        achieving it by interacting with the internet and documents, to pasting the finished documents and code 
        into their necessary locations.
    </p>
    <p>Were i to use github, i’d be able to keep my code files in multiple places to ensure their safety, and I’d 
        be able to take advantage of the resources there to elevate the quality of the code in preparation for its 
        final upload as a website.
