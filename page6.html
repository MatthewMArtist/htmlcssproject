    <p>When creating my website, I will have to use a number of different and even new systems and softwares. First 
        of all, I will need to use google and other such search engines in order to research coding methods. Then, 
        I will need to use python in visual studio code to create the website code, and then html to upload it on 
        google as a website. Whilst planning my website I will be using slack and trello to manage my projects 
        progress, so that i can see clearly what I am doing. Finally, I will need to use Css alongside HTML in order 
        to properly create the website to industry standard. In order to achieve all of this I will use both my 
        previous lessons to achieve related aspects, then research the other methods to a workable standard.
