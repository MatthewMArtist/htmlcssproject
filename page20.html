    <p>To begin with, those with colour blindness will find themselves unable to distinguish some colours 
        from others, meaning that certain combinations of them will be illegible from their perspective. 
        Furthermore, it may be necessary to account for those with photosensitive epilepsy, and thus I would 
        remove anything that might trigger a response in that disability. However, after analysing the 
        requirements needed to adhere to the needs of other disabilities, I have deemed it cost prohibitive 
        in time, skill and resources.
