    <p>My final product was effective because of its visual attractiveness in combination with its ease of use 
        and professional appearance. My combination of high resolution nature based background images and clean, 
        minimalist font choice gave the site an illusion of legitimacy. However, it lacked impressive coding 
        solutions or graphical features that would elevate it to a higher quality presentation level. The project 
        would be much better if i included effective drop down menus and other, similar graphical elements.
