    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 3, task 3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using 
        IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>Had i been in a team when i embarked on my project i would’ve drastically enhanced the amount of work 
        achieved, at the cost of hurdles in communication and planning beforehand. It would allow different team 
        members to be assigned different objectives suited to their skills, or allowed us to pool together our time 
        resources and mass produce code, such as occurred in my previous project. These would’ve improved our 
        productivity by giving our project the resources in time and effort of three or for people and thus make 
        our website three or four times better, as long as each team member is effective as one another.
