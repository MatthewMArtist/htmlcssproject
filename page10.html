    <h3 class = "text_font_2">Unit 1, outcome 2, task 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h3>
    <div class = "container_2 text_font_2">
    <p>The IT tools selected were all appropriate for the tasks required of them, enabling me to use them all 
        equally during the construction of my website. I found visual studio code to be as reliable as ever, 
        serving as a place to host the code i was working on. Google and sights such as slack and moodle were 
        valuable both for displaying the finished product and informing its development. In addition, I found both 
        coding languages to be easy to understand and implement, and my file folder was vital for the storage of 
        images which my project was built around.
